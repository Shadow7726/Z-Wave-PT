| Z-Wave Plus Feature | Potential Vulnerabilities |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Long Range (LR) Mode | Increased signal range: Expands attack surface. <br> Potential security downgrade for backward compatibility. |
| SmartStart | Simplified inclusion process: Weakens authentication. <br> Limited key exchange validation: Allows injection of malicious keys. |
| Secure Neighbor Discovery (SND) | Trust-based network formation: Exploitable by attackers with initial access. <br> Limited vulnerability disclosure: Harder to assess and address risks. |
| Z-Wave Plus Long Frame Format (ZPFF) | Increased data packet size: Potential for buffer overflows. <br> Complex protocol interactions: May introduce unforeseen vulnerabilities. |
| Z-Wave Security 2 (S2) Key Derivation Function (KDF) | Potential implementation weaknesses: Insecure implementations or weak random number generation. <br> Limited public scrutiny: Proprietary mechanism with less public analysis. |
