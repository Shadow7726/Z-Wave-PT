## Z-Wave networks do have IP connectivity at the gateway/controller level. 

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result | 
|-|-|-|  
| Gateway firmware analysis | Examine gateway firmware for vulnerabilities such as hardcoded credentials, insecure interfaces, etc. | Findings should be addressed through patching. |
| Gateway vulnerability scanning | Perform network vulnerability scans against gateway from LAN side. | Any critical or high vulnerabilities need to be patched. |  
| Gateway app traffic interception | Capture traffic between gateway and mobile/web apps. | App traffic should be encrypted end-to-end. |
| Gateway default credentials | Try using default usernames/passwords on gateway admin interfaces. | Defaults should be changed by user after installation. |
| Cloud service authentication | Test authentication implementation between cloud platform APIs and gateway. | Proper access key, token, or certificate based authentication should be enforced. |
| Cloud API fuzzing | Fuzz test cloud management APIs, looking for parsing issues, etc. | APIs should fail safely and not break. |
| Cloud service encryption | Examine encryption used between cloud and gateway. | TLS 1.2 or higher with updated cipher suites should be implemented. |
| Device access control | Test adding/removing devices from network via cloud. | Proper ownership controls should be enforced. |
| User session management | Check for issues with user sessions in cloud/mobile apps. | No sensitive actions should be allowed in unauthenticated states. |

This covers some key areas to focus on when testing the IP-connected attack surface of a Z-Wave implementation. The tests aim to identify weaknesses that could enable takeover or manipulation of the system.
